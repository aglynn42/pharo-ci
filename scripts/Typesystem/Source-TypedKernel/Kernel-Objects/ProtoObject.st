Generally these are proxy objects designed to read themselves in from the disk, or to perform some wrapper behavior, before responding to a message. Current examples are ObjectOut and ImageSegmentRootStub, and one could argue that ObjectTracer should also inherit from this class.ProtoObject has no instance variables, nor should any be added.!!ProtoObject methodsFor: 'apply primitives' stamp: 'EstebanAllende 3/29/2012 16:12'!(?) tryPrimitive: (Integer)primIndex withArgs: (Array)argumentArray	"This method is a template that the Smalltalk simulator uses to 	execute primitives.
