Notice how the truth-value checks become direct message sends, without the need for explicit testing.Be aware however that most of these methods are not sent as real messages in normal use. Most are inline coded by the compiler as test and jump bytecodes - avoiding the overhead of the full message sends. So simply redefining these methods here will have no effect.!!False methodsFor: 'controlling' stamp: 'EstebanAllende 2/21/2012 21:44'!(False) and: (→ Boolean)alternativeBlock 	"Nonevaluating conjunction -- answer with false since the receiver is false."	^self! !!False methodsFor: 'controlling' stamp: 'EstebanAllende 2/21/2012 21:44'!(?) ifFalse: (→ ?)alternativeBlock 	"Answer the value of alternativeBlock.
