Please Note:
------------

Pharo does not yet natively run on a 64bits Linux. Just install the ia32/i386 runtime libraries and you should be fine. On Ubuntu and other 
debian-based systems, these libraries are named 'ia32-libs'. Try `sudo aptitude install ia32-libs` or see http://pharo.org/gnu-linux-installation#64-bit-System-Setup for more info.
